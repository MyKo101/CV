### About Me

I am currently studying towards a PhD in Medicine with a focus on
statistics from both an applied and methodological perspective, whilst
working as a Maths and Stats Tutor and developing my skills as a keen
data scientist, particularly in R. I have experience in the public and
private sector, dealing primarily with medical and education data.

**PhD Student**, Oct ’16 - Present
<p>
The goal of this PhD is to improve the academic knowledge surrounding
Multi-State Clinical Prediction Models (MSCPMs). To accomplish this, I
am writing articles to solve methodological issues that are yet to be
addressed and applying these novel techniques (along with the present
literature) to develop and validate an MSCPM to predict outcomes for
Chronic Kidney Disease patients.

**Lead Statistician**, Jan ’17 - Feb ’19
<p>
Working within the University of Manchester, we formed a team of
statistical consultants to assist researchers from all levels of the
university with their statistical needs, this included help on specific
projects and tutorials on various statistical topics. Our efforts helped
educate undergraduate students on basic methods to improve their
coursework results and provided lecturers and professors with advice and
mentoring to focus their research questions and process their results to
produce viable academic outputs.

**Research Assistant**, Nov ’15 - Sep ’16
<p>
As part of the GetReal consortium, I worked within a multi-national team
producing methodological techniques to assist in bridging the gap
between efficacy and effectiveness in pragmatic clinical trials.
Alongside this methodological work, I was involved in an applied study
to assess the generalisability and the risk of a Hawthorn Effect in the
Salford Lung Study (SLS), a real-world, pragmatic randomised controlled
trial.

Primarily focused on the deliverables for the SLS. I produced
standardised datasets for our pharmaceutical client, ad hoc data
analyses and standard operating procedures for the clinical research
group. I developed an algorithm utilising a probabilistic model for the
merging of pharmacy data with electronic health records sourced from
local primary and secondary care data and electronic case report forms
provided by the onsite research nurses.
