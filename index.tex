\subsubsection{About Me}\label{about-me}}

Expert data scientist with a Masters Degree in Mathematics, approaching
completion of a PhD in Medicine with a focus on Statistics. Achievements
include 10\% improvement in effective productivity in examination
marking, the creation of SAPs and SOPs for a pioneering pragmatic
clinical trial and the development and validation of a multi-state
clinical predication model, as well as the methodological advancements
to produce such a model. I have a multitude of published works including
packages in R, where my most recent experience lies, articles in high
impact journals covering methodology and clinical advances. Highly
skilled in data processing, visualisation and model building.

\hline
\hspace{1em}\textbf{ PhD Student }, Oct '16 - Present\newline The goal of this PhD is to improve the academic knowledge surrounding Multi-State Clinical Prediction Models (MSCPMs). To accomplish this, I am writing articles to solve methodological issues that are yet to be addressed and applying these novel techniques (along with the present literature) to develop and validate an MSCPM to predict outcomes for Chronic Kidney Disease patients. & \textbf{ Lead Statistician }, Jan '17 - Feb '19\newline Working within the University of Manchester, we formed a team of statistical consultants to assist researchers from all levels of the university with their statistical needs, this included help on specific projects and tutorials on various statistical topics. Our efforts helped educate undergraduate students on basic methods to improve their coursework results and provided lecturers and professors with advice and mentoring to focus their research questions and process their results to produce viable academic outputs.\\
\hspace{1em}\textbf{ Research Assistant }, Nov '15 - Sep '16\newline As part of the GetReal consortium, I worked within a multi-national team producing methodological techniques to assist in bridging the gap between efficacy and effectiveness in pragmatic clinical trials. Alongside this methodological work, I was involved in an applied study to assess the generalisability and the risk of a Hawthorn Effect in the Salford Lung Study (SLS), a real-world, pragmatic randomised controlled trial. & \textbf{ Assistant Statistician }, Aug '14 - Apr '15\newline Primarily focused on the deliverables for the SLS. I produced standardised datasets for our pharmaceutical client, ad hoc data analyses and standard operating procedures for the clinical research group. I developed an algorithm utilising a probabilistic model for the merging of pharmacy data with electronic health records sourced from local primary and secondary care data and electronic case report forms provided by the onsite research nurses.\\
